        <div class="tablatext">The music I listen to, has always had a huge impact in my life. Having immersed myself in the intricate rhythms and melodic nuances of the tabla for two years during my childhood, my musical journey began with this traditional Indian percussion instrument. Although my current passion lies in modern hip-hop, jazz and experimental music, my early experience with the tabla continues to influence and shape my appreciation for diverse musical genres.</div>
